## About Me
Iâ€™ve been an Assistant Professor at [Princeton ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) since 2019. I work on **deep learning, probability, and spectral asymptotics.** Prior to Princeton, I was an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at Texas A&M, an NSF Postdoc at MIT Math, and a PhD student in Math at Northwestern, where I was supervised by Steve Zelditch. I am grateful to be supported by an NSF CAREER grant DMS-2143754 and NSF grants DMS-1855684, DMS-2133806. I am also a consultant for an ONR MURI on Foundations of Deep Learning.

  <li> I am currently looking for grad students and postdocs. If you a student at Princeton looking to work on deep learning theory, feel free to reach out (see also this somewhat tongue-in-cheek [writeup](boris-hanin.github.io/Working_With_Me.pdf))</li>
  <li> I am organizing the 2023 Princeton Deep Learning Theory Summer School. Website coming soon. Similar to [last year's school](https://mlschool.princeton.edu/) .</li>
