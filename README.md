# Boris Hanin

## About Me
Iâ€™ve been an Assistant Professor at [Prince[CV.pdf](https://github.com/boris-hanin/boris-hanin.github.io/files/10208155/CV.pdf)
ton ORFE](https://orfe.princeton.edu/) since 2019. I work on **deep learning, probability, and spectral asymptotics.** Prior to Princeton, I was an Assistant Professor in Mathematics at Texas A&M, an NSF Postdoc at MIT Math, and a PhD student in Math at Northwestern, where I was supervised by Steve Zelditch. I am grateful to be supported by an NSF CAREER grant DMS-2143754 and NSF grants DMS-1855684, DMS-2133806. I am also a consultant for an ONR MURI on Foundations of Deep Learning.

-  I am organizing the 2023 Princeton Deep Learning Theory Summer School. Website coming soon. Similar to [last year's school](https://mlschool.princeton.edu/).
